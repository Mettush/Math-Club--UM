# UMiami-Math-Club

Welcome to the github for the math club. You can find the schedule, presentation abstracts, and other math resources here!

## Why start Math Club?

People interested in math are sparse here @ the U. Therefore, we believe it is essential to create a sense of community of those interested in mathematics, hence the founding of this club.

## What do we do in Math Club?

Every Monday @5 in Ungar 411, we host a student presentation in a topic of their interest.
Topics have ranged from a variety of topics, and we leave it to the speaker to make their presentation engaging.

## How should I schedule a presentation?

Reach out to any e-board member to reserve a spot! 
Once you get a time-slot, we suggest you do extensive research in the field of your interest and 
require that all presenters send a short summary of their presentation to any e-board member at least **1 week** before the presentation date.
